A classic problem involving hashmaps is getting a list of names and returning the most common names.

Suppose we are given a file with a list of names in the following format:

lastname, firstname

Output the following:
1. The unique count of full, last, and first names (i.e. duplicates are
     counted only once)
2. The ten most common last names (the names and number of occurrences)
3. The ten most common first names (the names and number of occurrences)
