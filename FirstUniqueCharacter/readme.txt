Yet another classic problem.

A unique character is a character that occurs only once in a string

Given a string:

Write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) the first unique character

If the given string does not contain any unique character please print -1


For example,
given text: "ab2cbZ2daZ"

You should output: c
